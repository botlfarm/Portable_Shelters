# Portable_Shelters

We use these shelters for our pigs, sheep and goats. On our farm the primary mode of moving items is our tractor. These shelters are designed to be moved with a pallet fork attachment on a tractor. They provide portable weather and shade shelter during the summer and during the winter they are stacked end to end creating a larger semi permanent winter shelter. 


## Design criteria
* Able to be moved with our tractor (Kubota L48)
    * We accomplish this with a pallet fork attachment on the tractor. 
    * Our forks are 4' long
    * The fork length dictates the total depth of the shelter. We need to be able to reach past center form the end so we can lift the shelter
* Able to be moved into position without letting animals out of their current paddock
    * This requirement dictated that the shelters be lifted from the top so they can be lifted over fence lines without opening gates
    * The Maximum lift height of our tractor is about 10 ft. The fences are max of of 4 feet so this meant the shelters must be less than 6' to the lift points
* For ease of construction the sidewalls would use a 4 ft sheet of plywood without having to cut it down
   * Note the side walls are now cut from 1"x boards
* There must be ability for the goats to get to the top of the shelter
    * Goats like climbing things so adding rails to both sides of the shelter helps meet this requirement
* for winter time we need to reduce the amount of wind through the shelters
    * initially we closed the ends with pallets during the winter and took off the pallets during the summer
    * In the most recent version there are half walls built in on both sides of the shelter
